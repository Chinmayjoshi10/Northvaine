# Later

Ideas parked until after 30 Oct.

- Harness (SOPs, RFQs, quotes)
- Team features (territories, assignment, permissions)
- Email/Slack/Telegram/WhatsApp channels
- Apollo/Clay/customs data connectors
- Agent-Readiness Score web tool
- Jev or other classifier behind the decision layer

Parked from milestone 1 planning (to pick up in the milestone that needs them):
- SQLAlchemy table metadata + repository layer; versioned Pydantic payload models for JSONB
- HNSW vector indexes + EMBED_DIM ALTER (M2); /health/db endpoint + engine disposal on shutdown
- mypy in the gate; pytest-socket "no network in tests" enforcement; CI (outward-facing)
- 180-day document retention job; enum CHECKs for hypotheses.kind, messages.channel, inbound_queries.channel
- Cross-org pooling of beliefs

After the hackathon, the first new lens (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §0.2):
- **Company watch / market intelligence:** continuously learn the operational state of
  companies from public evidence (SEC EDGAR filings and XBRL, Companies House, procurement
  awards, patents, hiring, facilities) and alert on emerging transitions and expected next
  events, personalised per analyst. Never stock-price prediction or investment advice.
